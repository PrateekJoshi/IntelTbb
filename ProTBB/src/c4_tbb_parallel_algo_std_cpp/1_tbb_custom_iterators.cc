// The zip iterator interface was part of older TBB versions (like TBB 2020 and earlier).
// With the release of oneTBB 2021, Intel revamped the library, focusing on a simplified and modernized API.
// As part of this overhaul, experimental or less-used features like tbb::zip_iterator were removed to streamline the codebase and reduce maintenance complexity.
