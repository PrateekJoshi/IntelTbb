# Ignore all .cpp files in the 'tests' directory, but not subdirectories
# test/*.cpp

# Ignore all files matching a pattern anywhere in the project (e.g., all files ending with _autogen.cpp)
**/*_autogen.cpp

# Example of a negated pattern:
# Ignore everything in 'src', but then re-include main.cpp
# This is less common for directories, but shows the syntax
# src/*
# !src/main.cpp
